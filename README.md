# Rove
Rove is a social media app for digital nomads, people who have embraced the traveling lifestyle due to the rapid expansion of remote work.


## About
Rove allows users, who sign-up for free profiles, to connect with other digital nomads via friend requests. It allows users to share pictures and stories of their travels and build out their own profile.

To supplement sharing and chatting with friends, users can discover new cities, rate places they have visited, view users and a post feed of users in that city.
